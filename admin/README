The kdewebdev package contains applications which are useful for web
development. They are runtime dependencies of Quanta Plus, and it is
highly recommended that you install them.

The extra applications are:

Kommander: a GUI script builder and executor tool. Needed for some Quanta functionality.
KFileReplace: powerful search and replace in multiple files
KImageMapEditor: image map editor
KLinkStatus: link checker

Be sure to read the README files in each application's directory.
